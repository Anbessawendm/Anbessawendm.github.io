  <p>While many of the Tigray churches are dug into the ground or monolithic with roofs at ground level, the church at Abuna Yemata Guh is pure-play rock-hewn. Almost a part of the mountains of the Hawzen Woreda it blends with the vertical rock spire in the rugged mountainside.
With so many ancient rock churches to choose from, the one at Abuna Yemata Guh tests your spiritual rigour as much as physical prowess. The trek up to the church is dangerous and adrenaline-high, testing both your patience and resilience. The church itself is perched dangerously on the cliff-side, with a 200-250 m drop on the sides, making you wonder how families grit it out to visit the church for Sunday services. To reach it, you must scale a sheer wall of rock and inch along a precipitous ledge, all in bare feet because you are on holy ground. Is it any wonder that Abuna Yemata Guh is said to be the worldâ€™s least accessible places of worship.</p>
